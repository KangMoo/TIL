### 멀티스레드 및 백그라운드

- 리눅스에서는 command 뒤에 `&`를 붙이면 백그라운드로 동작하게 되며, 리눅스의 예약어 `$!`로 해당 PID값을 갖고 있게 되면, 그 프로세스를 제어할 수 있다

### 샘플코드

```shell
#!/bin/bash

THREAD()
{
  while [ 1 ]
  do
    echo "THREAD 1 : $1"
    sleep 1
  done
}

echo "CALL 1st thread - Background Operating"
THREAD first&
THREAD_1st_PID=$!

echo "THREAD PID : $THREAD_1st_PID"
sleep 5
echo "Wait 5sec -> 1st thread suspend 5sec  "
echo "CALL 2nd thread - Background Operating"
kill -19 $THREAD_1st_PID
THREAD second&
THREAD_2nd_PID=$!
sleep 5

echo "Wait 5sec -> 1st thread continue 5sec  "
kill -18 $THREAD_1st_PID
sleep 5
kill -9 $THREAD_1st_PID $THREAD_2nd_PID
```
